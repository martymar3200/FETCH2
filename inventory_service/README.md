# FETCH API

An API serving the Findings Environment for Collected Holdings application

# Setup

This is a containerized application for both local and deployed environments.  Below steps will get you up and running locally. Virtual Environment management is only needed for developers who will be updating the application's dependencies and working with scripts. Otherwise, everything is handled inside Containers managed out of the `fetch-local` repository.

## Podman
This project assumes you have locally setup [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/). It is posssible to use Homebrew for this. https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/podman-desktop

## Poetry
This project's environment and dependencies are managed with Poetry.

[Poetry's](https://python-poetry.org/) workflow ties the developer's virtual environment to the project itself, allowing for rapid ramp-up, team standardization, and reduced maintenance divergence.  Poetry [provides hooks](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pre-commit-hooks/) to integrate with pre-commit, further ensuring dependency integrity on commits. This includes synchronization of Poetry's dependency management with the traditional `requirements.txt` used in Python frameworks. Finally, poetry also streamlines the process of publishing a Python package on PyPy should the need arise.

### Installation
```sh
$ python3 -m ensurepip
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip3 install poetry==1.6.1
```

### Configuration

Configure poetry to store `.venv` inside project structure (this is .gitignored).

```sh
$ poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

## Virtual Environment

First install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation), and add it to your `PATH`
```sh
$ brew install pyenv
$ nano $HOME/.zshenv

# In .zshenv
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```
Save your zsh environment, exit, and then reload the shell with `$ zsh -l`

Now create a local virtual environment.
```sh
$ cd path/to/repository/root
$ poetry install
```

Activate the environment and verify everything looks right.
```sh
$ poetry shell
$ poetry env info
$ python --version
$ where python
```
If your terminal / shell supports it, the activated virtual environment will also display in your prompt. e.g `(api-py3.11)` or rather `(<project-name>-python version)`.

If / when you want to get out of the environment, simply `$ exit` or `$ deactivate`

Dependency management
```sh
$ poetry add <package>
$ poetry remove <package>
```

If you are using VSCode (or any IDE debugger), I'd recommend switching your debug interpretter to this virtual env so that it'll have all dependencies met. There is an included launch profile for debugging in VSCode for convenience.

# Run

```
./helper.sh build local
```
(Though I recommend instead running the whole project from the fetch-local repo instead).

Simply calling the command again will take care of tear down and rebuild. The application should now be running on your localhost at http://127.0.0.1:8001/

Under the hood, the image takes the necessary steps to generate the API's package requirements from the pyproject.toml and poetry lock files.

Additional helpful commands:

* `./helper.sh build-db` - Rebuilds the inventory-database container.
* `./helper.sh rebuild-db` - Wipes the inventory-database volume and re-seeds fake data.


# Project

## Settings

Environment variables should be set through the environment. The [Pydantic settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/) system is used to set default values for expected `.env` keys. The application will automatically override these if matching keys are found in the environment.

For local builds there is no need to have a `.env` file.  For deployed environments, devops should handle seeding this file into the repository root before building.

The container images then move `.env` into the config directory at build, and `python-dotenv` is used to ensure parsing occurs prior to building the Pydantic Settings class.

## Containerization

The Python Slim image is used as a base for the container.  This image itself is based on Debian:Buster, thus any need to interact with the container system should refer to Debian documentation.


## Database Migrations

[Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) is used for migration management. The target database for the Inventory Service is `inventory_service`.

Revision logic has been configured to output with an inverted date format instead of the default random strings Alembic would normally generate. This allows our files to be sequential, and the history command to display reverse chronological order.

```sh
2023_10_15_06:52:16 -> 2023_10_15_06:54:53 (head), Add Module table
2023_10_15_06:33:28 -> 2023_10_15_06:52:16, Add Module Number table
<base> -> 2023_10_15_06:33:28, Add building table
```

Add models for Alembic tracking in `/migrations/models.py`. The order of import is initially important when first adding new tables, as to satisfy the dependency of foreign key relationships. After a migration file is generated though, it's safe to allow our pre-commit hooks to sort imports however it likes.

Unlike other common migration tools, Alembic only stores the current version in the database.  We should assume that all previous revisions in the dowgrade history have been applied.  A future task may be to add a separate tracking table.

Commands:

```sh
# Add a new migration file
alembic revision -m "Update some model field" --autogenerate

# Run all migrations up to the latest
alembic upgrade head

# Reverse the last migration
alembic downgrade -1

# Revert to a previous migration
alembic downgrade [target_version]

# Show the current migration version in the database
alembic current

# List version migration scripts in order
alembic history
```

Helper commands have been created to allow CLI migration management from outside a running container on local only (future support may be added for other environments by simply updating the MIGRATION_URL environment variable for those environments).

* `./helper.sh makemigrations "Your Message Here"` - generates a new migration
* `./helper.sh migrate` - runs alembic upgrade head
* `./helper.sh current` - Reports the current db migration.

## Deployment

Containerfiles are used in deployment. For deployed environments, Kubernetes / Terraform uses the repository root for the build context. In local environments, we use either a build script or a compose file in the `fetch-local` repository, which assumes a different build context.  This is why pathing is different between the images.

# Authentication System

This application supports two types of authentication. A legacy login endpoint is available for accepting a username and password in a POST request.  This is only available in debug, local, dev, and test environments. The other method uses Single-Sign on in SAML communication with an Identity Provider. This method is available over all environments.

## Local and Debug

The Identity Provider is configured to relay to the acs endpoint on a localhost environment, but may only do so over https.  To support this, the local container build uses a self-signed certificate which is generated at build time.  Your browser may still give warnings about an untrusted certificate. You can either just bypass it in the browser, or (if on Mac) you can add these local certs to your keychain to stop getting the browser warning.  A VSCode launch profile is included in this repository, and that too, makes use of generated self-signed certs for localhost over https.

## SSO Design

The API exposes a login route, and a Assertion Consumer Service route for forwarding users to the identity provider, and receiving communication back from the idenity provider.  SAML configuration for the environments is slightly different.  At the time of this writing, these are separated via config files. At a future date, configuration should move entirely to the environment and be loaded in-memory only.

When the ACS endpoint receives an encrypted re-direction with user Auth data, it then checks and / or creates a user in the FETCH database before issuing its own encrypted token for use with the front-end application.  Such a token is necessary for successful ongoing use of the FETCH webapp in an authenticated state.

## Audit Log
A table has been created to store the audit log of table updates. The log is updated based on triggers added to each of the model tables.
There are three migrations which initially set this up. One to create the table, the second to create the function, and the last to add the trigger to each of the existing tables.
There is minimal code changed to support this, namely setting the user based off the user token in the request on post, patch, and deletes.

** It will be necessary to add a trigger to any new table which is added, but it is a simple migration which can be referenced from the third migration add_trigger_to_tables.

There are no endpoints to retrieve audits yet, but they are populating in the database. System run operations, such as seeding, will have the postgres user in the audit log.

# Migrating A Legacy Database

## About

Migrating a legacy database is supported with the use of some built in scripts. This is not to be confused with
"migrations" which is a common term used in modern backend applications for schema management with the ORM.

ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load(ing)) a database from a legacy system is not completely hands-off, as your
legacy data structure will likely vary some from other applications which used the same software.  The below sections
will help you prepare to leverage the legacy data migration scripts, and point out areas that you
may need to tailor to fit your needs

More coming soon...

## Output

The output of running the legacy migration scripts is a compressed `.sql` file, and a collection of `.csv` reports.
The `.sql` file is to be used for running a `pg_restore` against an empty `inventory_service` database. It is a completely optimized sequence of instructions that will allow moving a database within minutes (as opposed to the days of processing it takes to create). The `.csv` reports render a collection of all errors, with different data operation sections broken out to differentiate ingest issues based on the database table being processed.

More coming soon...

## Setup

The scripts expect files with the following names to be dropped inside of the `/app/seed/legacy_snapshot` directory. These files should not be committed to version control

```txt
Coming soon
```

You also are expected to field static data types in the following templates under `/app/seed/fixtures/entities` and `/app/seed/fixtures/types`.  These templates are an efficient way for us to include data in the database being built, that isn't necessarily captured from the snapshot files of the legacy system. The expected fixtures are as follows:

```txt
Coming soon
```

More coming soon...

## Running

This migration scripts are intended to be run in a local environment while all application containers are running on the Podman Desktop machine. You should be operating in a unix or linux environment yourself.  This is ideally MacOS, but can be a Linux distro, or WSL on a Windows machine.

All below commands assume you've cloned components of the application in a workspace directory under your user. `~/workspace/fetch/inventory_service`, `~/workspace/fetch/fetch-local` and `~/workspace/fetch/database`.

Build & run the FETCH app from the `fetch-local` context.
```sh
podman compose up --build
```
If this is your first time building the application, this should get you running with the application's schema migrations (database tables) defined in the `inventory_service` database, and you can skip the next command.  Otherwise, you'll need to run `refresh-db`.

(Note - this currently still calls fake data seeding, but that feature will be removed in the near future and this comment will be removed)
```sh
./helper.sh refresh-db
```

Now that you have the database tables of the application set up, you can call the data migration script.
```sh
./helper.sh run-data-migration
```
The script will log out what is processing from the spreadsheets you placed in the `legacy_snapshot` directory.

This processing will take hours, possibly upwards of 72 - 84, depending on your machine, your podman resource allocation, and the size of the database you are translating / ingesting. Once it completes, the logs will give a summary report. Detailed reporting will have been piped to files in the container. If there were no errors on a given section, the file for that section won't actually be generated.

More coming soon...

After processing is complete, run the following helper command to extract the output files from the inventory service container
to your local operating system


```sh
./helper.sh extract-data-migration
```

This will create a directory on your machine at `~/Desktop/fetch_migration`. If there were errors during processing, error files will be inside an errors folder inside this directory. Otherwise you will just see a compressed `.gz` sql file.

It's important to note the logical intention of an error in these reports, is first and foremost to capture if a given row of data was unprocessible. It is not intended to have an opinion on data outcome in processing.

## Deployed Database Creation

Now that you have the `.sql` file, you need to use it to create your deployed database.

Coming soon...
