# FETCH API

An API serving the Findings Environment for Collected Holdings application

# Setup

This is a containerized application for both local and deployed environments.  Below steps will get you up and running locally. Virtual Environment management is only needed for developers who will be updating the application's dependencies and working with scripts. Otherwise, everything is handled inside Containers managed out of the `fetch-local` repository.

## Container Runtime
This project uses containers for both local and deployed environments. You can use either [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/).

> **Note:** The `fetch-local` compose workflow uses `docker compose` commands. The standalone build scripts in this directory (`dev-build.sh`, `test-build.sh`) use `podman` directly. Both tools use compatible CLI syntax and compose file formats.

## Poetry
This project's environment and dependencies are managed with Poetry.

[Poetry's](https://python-poetry.org/) workflow ties the developer's virtual environment to the project itself, allowing for rapid ramp-up, team standardization, and reduced maintenance divergence.  Poetry [provides hooks](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pre-commit-hooks/) to integrate with pre-commit, further ensuring dependency integrity on commits. This includes synchronization of Poetry's dependency management with the traditional `requirements.txt` used in Python frameworks. Finally, poetry also streamlines the process of publishing a Python package on PyPy should the need arise.

### Installation
```sh
$ python3 -m ensurepip
$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip3 install poetry==1.6.1
```

### Configuration

Configure poetry to store `.venv` inside project structure (this is .gitignored).

```sh
$ poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

## Virtual Environment

First install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation), and add it to your `PATH`
```sh
$ brew install pyenv
$ nano $HOME/.zshenv

# In .zshenv
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```
Save your zsh environment, exit, and then reload the shell with `$ zsh -l`

Now create a local virtual environment.
```sh
$ cd path/to/repository/root
$ poetry install
```

Activate the environment and verify everything looks right.
```sh
$ poetry shell
$ poetry env info
$ python --version
$ where python
```
If your terminal / shell supports it, the activated virtual environment will also display in your prompt. e.g `(api-py3.11)` or rather `(<project-name>-python version)`.

If / when you want to get out of the environment, simply `$ exit` or `$ deactivate`

Dependency management
```sh
$ poetry add <package>
$ poetry remove <package>
```

If you are using VSCode (or any IDE debugger), I'd recommend switching your debug interpretter to this virtual env so that it'll have all dependencies met. There is an included launch profile for debugging in VSCode for convenience.

# Run

```
./helper.sh build local
```
(Though I recommend instead running the whole project from the fetch-local repo instead).

Simply calling the command again will take care of tear down and rebuild. The application should now be running on your localhost at http://127.0.0.1:8001/

Under the hood, the image takes the necessary steps to generate the API's package requirements from the pyproject.toml and poetry lock files.

Additional helpful commands:

* `./helper.sh build-db` - Rebuilds the inventory-database container.
* `./helper.sh rebuild-db` - Wipes the inventory-database volume and re-seeds fake data.


# Project

## Settings

Environment variables should be set through the environment. The [Pydantic settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/pydantic_settings/) system is used to set default values for expected `.env` keys. The application will automatically override these if matching keys are found in the environment.

For local builds there is no need to have a `.env` file.  For deployed environments, devops should handle seeding this file into the repository root before building.

The container images then move `.env` into the config directory at build, and `python-dotenv` is used to ensure parsing occurs prior to building the Pydantic Settings class.

## Containerization

The Python Slim image is used as a base for the container.  This image itself is based on Debian:Buster, thus any need to interact with the container system should refer to Debian documentation.


## Database Migrations

[Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) is used for migration management. The target database for the Inventory Service is `inventory_service`.

Revision logic has been configured to output with an inverted date format instead of the default random strings Alembic would normally generate. This allows our files to be sequential, and the history command to display reverse chronological order.

```sh
2023_10_15_06:52:16 -> 2023_10_15_06:54:53 (head), Add Module table
2023_10_15_06:33:28 -> 2023_10_15_06:52:16, Add Module Number table
<base> -> 2023_10_15_06:33:28, Add building table
```

Add models for Alembic tracking in `/migrations/models.py`. The order of import is initially important when first adding new tables, as to satisfy the dependency of foreign key relationships. After a migration file is generated though, it's safe to allow our pre-commit hooks to sort imports however it likes.

Unlike other common migration tools, Alembic only stores the current version in the database.  We should assume that all previous revisions in the dowgrade history have been applied.  A future task may be to add a separate tracking table.

Commands:

```sh
# Add a new migration file
alembic revision -m "Update some model field" --autogenerate

# Run all migrations up to the latest
alembic upgrade head

# Reverse the last migration
alembic downgrade -1

# Revert to a previous migration
alembic downgrade [target_version]

# Show the current migration version in the database
alembic current

# List version migration scripts in order
alembic history
```

Helper commands have been created to allow CLI migration management from outside a running container on local only (future support may be added for other environments by simply updating the MIGRATION_URL environment variable for those environments).

* `./helper.sh makemigrations "Your Message Here"` - generates a new migration
* `./helper.sh migrate` - runs alembic upgrade head
* `./helper.sh current` - Reports the current db migration.

## Deployment

Containerfiles are used in deployment. For deployed environments, Kubernetes / Terraform uses the repository root for the build context. In local environments, we use either a build script or a compose file in the `fetch-local` repository, which assumes a different build context.  This is why pathing is different between the images.

## VS Code IDE: Python Configuration

1. Install Visual Studio Code
If you haven't already, download and install VS Code from the official website.

Setting up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for Python code formatting involves installing and configuring extensions and tools that help in linting and formatting your Python code. Here's a step-by-step guide to set up VS Code for Python development with code formatting:

1.1. Install Visual Studio Code
If you haven't already, download and install VS Code from the official website.

2. Install the Python Extension
The Python extension for VS Code provides a rich set of features including linting, debugging, IntelliSense, code navigation, code formatting, etc.

Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar, or press Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for Python (look for the extension published by Microsoft).
Click on the Install button.
3. Install Python
Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website. VS Code's Python extension will automatically detect the installed Python interpreters.

4. Select Python Interpreter
Open a Python file or create a new one.
Click on the Python version in the status bar at the bottom or use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Python: Select Interpreter to choose the appropriate interpreter for your project.
5. Install Formatting Tools
VS Code supports various Python code formatters. The most popular ones are autopep8, black, and yapf. You can install them using pip:
```
pip install autopep8
pip install black
pip install yapf
```
6. Configure the Formatter in VS Code
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
Type Preferences: Open Settings (JSON).
Add or modify the following settings to select your preferred formatter (e.g., black):
```
{
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

7. Optional: Configure Linting
VS Code's Python extension supports various linters like pylint, flake8, mypy, etc. To use a linter:

Install the linter, e.g., for pylint:
```
pip install pylint
```
2. Configure VS Code to use the linter:
```
{
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true
}
```

8. Test Your Setup
Create or open a Python file and write some code. Try saving the file to see if it gets formatted automatically.


# Authentication System

This application supports two types of authentication. A legacy login endpoint is available for accepting a username and password in a POST request.  This is only available in debug, local, dev, and test environments. The other method uses Single-Sign on in SAML communication with an Identity Provider. This method is available over all environments.

## Local and Debug

The Identity Provider is configured to relay to the acs endpoint on a localhost environment, but may only do so over https.  To support this, the local container build uses a self-signed certificate which is generated at build time.  Your browser may still give warnings about an untrusted certificate. You can either just bypass it in the browser, or (if on Mac) you can add these local certs to your keychain to stop getting the browser warning.  A VSCode launch profile is included in this repository, and that too, makes use of generated self-signed certs for localhost over https.

## SSO Design

The API exposes a login route, and a Assertion Consumer Service route for forwarding users to the identity provider, and receiving communication back from the idenity provider.  SAML configuration for the environments is slightly different.  At the time of this writing, these are separated via config files. At a future date, configuration should move entirely to the environment and be loaded in-memory only.

When the ACS endpoint receives an encrypted re-direction with user Auth data, it then checks and / or creates a user in the FETCH database before issuing its own encrypted token for use with the front-end application.  Such a token is necessary for successful ongoing use of the FETCH webapp in an authenticated state.

## Audit Log
A table has been created to store the audit log of table updates. The log is updated based on triggers added to each of the model tables.
There are three migrations which initially set this up. One to create the table, the second to create the function, and the last to add the trigger to each of the existing tables.
There is minimal code changed to support this, namely setting the user based off the user token in the request on post, patch, and deletes.

** It will be necessary to add a trigger to any new table which is added, but it is a simple migration which can be referenced from the third migration add_trigger_to_tables.

Audit log records can be viewed through the Admin panel in the frontend application. The audit trail API is available at `/audit-trails/`.

# ILS Integration

The Inventory Service includes an Integrated Library System (ILS) integration framework using an adapter pattern. This allows FETCH2 to communicate with external ILS platforms (e.g., FOLIO) for operations such as check-in synchronization during refile workflows.

## Architecture

The integration is built on a pluggable adapter interface located in `app/ils/`:

- **`interfaces.py`** — Defines the abstract `ILSAdapter` interface
- **`folio_adapter.py`** — Production adapter implementing FOLIO API communication via OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials
- **`mock_adapter.py`** — Mock adapter for local development and testing
- **`factory.py`** — Factory that selects the appropriate adapter based on environment configuration
- **`tasks.py`** — Background tasks for automated ILS synchronization (e.g., refile check-in hooks)

## Configuration

ILS configuration is managed through the Admin panel in the frontend under **Admin > ILS Configuration**. The API endpoints are available at `/ils-configurations/`. Sync errors are tracked at `/ils-sync-errors/` and viewable in the Admin UI.


# Testing

The Inventory Service has a comprehensive pytest-based test suite located in the `tests/` directory. Tests are organized by layer:

- **`tests/domain/test_inventory_entities.py`** — Core SQLAlchemy model and constraint tests
- **`tests/domain/test_location_hierarchy.py`** — Location hierarchy cascade and uniqueness tests
- **`tests/domain/test_job_workflows.py`** — Full API-level workflow tests covering all 7 job types (Accession, Verification, Shelving, Picklist, Shipping, Refile, Withdrawal)
- **`tests/auth/test_rbac.py`** — Role-based access control security tests

See `tests/README.md` for detailed documentation on each test module and guidance on writing new tests.

## Running Tests

Tests require Docker or Podman to spin up an isolated PostgreSQL container on port 5433:

```sh
pytest
```

The test infrastructure automatically creates a disposable database, runs Alembic migrations, seeds test data, and tears everything down after completion.
